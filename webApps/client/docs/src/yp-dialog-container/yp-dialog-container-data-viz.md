It appears you've provided import statements for TypeScript files related to some components, possibly web components, from a `yp-collection` directory. However, to generate API documentation in Markdown format, I would need the actual TypeScript code that defines the classes, properties, methods, and events for these components.

Please provide the TypeScript source code for `yp-data-visualization.js` and `yp-group-data-viz.js`, and I will be able to generate the appropriate API documentation in Markdown format for you.
