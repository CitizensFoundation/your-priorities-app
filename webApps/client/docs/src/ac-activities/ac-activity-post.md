# AcActivityPost

`AcActivityPost` is a custom web component that extends `YpPostBaseWithAnswers`, which in turn extends `AcActivityWithGroupBase`. It represents an activity post with a cover media, a title, a description, and potentially a group header. It is styled specifically for different screen sizes and provides a method to navigate to the post when clicked.
