# AcActivityPost

`AcActivityPost` is a custom element that extends `YpPostBaseWithAnswers` and `AcActivityWithGroupBase` to render a post with its associated activity and group information. It includes styles for layout and responsiveness, and it uses `yp-magic-text` and `yp-post-cover-media` components to display the post's name and cover media. The element also provides a method to navigate to the post's detail page and checks for Internet Explorer 11 compatibility.
