# SharedStyles

SharedStyles is a constant that holds the CSS template literal for styling components using the `lit` library.

## Properties

There are no properties for this constant as it is a CSS template literal exported for use in styled components.

## Methods

There are no methods for this constant as it is not a class or object with functionality beyond being a template literal.

## Examples

```typescript
import { SharedStyles } from './path-to-shared-styles';

// Example usage in a lit-element
class MyCustomElement extends LitElement {
  static styles = [SharedStyles, css`
    /* Additional custom styles */
    :host {
      display: block;
    }
  `];

  render() {
    return html`
      <div class="questionTitle">Title of the Question</div>
    `;
  }
}
```

In the example above, `SharedStyles` is imported and used within a custom element that extends `LitElement`. The styles defined in `SharedStyles` are applied to the elements within the `render` method of the custom element, specifically to an element with the class `questionTitle`.
