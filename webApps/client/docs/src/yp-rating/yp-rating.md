# YpRating

`YpRating` is a custom web component that extends `YpBaseElement` to provide a rating system using emojis. Users can rate by clicking on the emoji icons, which can be configured to be read-only or interactive. The component supports a maximum of 5 ratings and emits custom events when a rating is added or deleted.
