<h1 id="audio-tracks">Audio Tracks</h1>
<p>Audio Tracks are a function of HTML5 video for providing alternative audio track selections to the user, so that a track other than the main track can be played. Video.js makes audio tracks work across all browsers. There are currently five types of tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: alternative audio for the main video track</li>
<li><strong>Descriptions</strong>: descriptions of what is happening in the video track</li>
<li><strong>Main</strong>: the main audio track for this video</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: a translation of the main audio track</li>
<li><strong>Commentary</strong>: commentary on the video, usually the director of the content talking about design choices</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missing-funtionality">Missing Funtionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is currently impossible to add AudioTracks in a non-programtic way</li>
<li>Literal switching of AudioTracks for playback is not handled by video.js and must be handled by something else. video.js only stores the track representation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-to-video-js">Adding to Video.js</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now adding audio tracks in the HTML is unsupported. Audio Tracks must be added programatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must add audio tracks <a href="#api">programatically</a> for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Audio Track propertites and settings</p>
<h3 id="kind">kind</h3>
<p>One of the five track types listed above. Kind defaults to empty string if no kind is included, or an invalid kind is used.</p>
<h3 id="label">label</h3>
<p>The label for the track that will be show to the user, for example in a menu that list the different languages available for audio tracks.</p>
<h3 id="language">language</h3>
<p>The two-letter code (valid BCP 47 language tag) for the language of the audio track, for example &quot;en&quot; for English. A list of language codes is <a href="languages.md#language-codes">available here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="enabled">enabled</h3>
<p>If this track should be playing or not. In video.js we only allow one track to be enabled at a time. so if you enable more than one the last one to be enabled will end up being the only one.</p>
<h2 id="interacting-with-audio-tracks">Interacting with Audio Tracks</h2>
<h3 id="doing-something-when-a-track-becomes-enabled">Doing something when a track becomes enabled</h3>
<p>When a new track is enabled (other than the main track) an event is fired on the <code>AudioTrackList</code> called <code>change</code> you can listen to that event and do something with it.
Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">// get the current players AudioTrackList object
let tracks = player.audioTracks();

// listen to the change event
tracks.addEventListener(&#39;change&#39;, function() {

  // print the currently enabled AudioTrack label
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; tracks.length; i++) {
    let track = tracks[i];

    if (track.enabled) {
      console.log(track.label);
      return;
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<h3 id="-player-audiotracks-audiotracklist-"><code>player.audioTracks() -&gt; AudioTrackList</code></h3>
<p>This is the main interface into the audio tracks of the player.
It returns an AudioTrackList which is an array like object that contains all the <code>AudioTrack</code> on the player.</p>
<h3 id="-player-audiotracks-addtrack-audiotrack-"><code>player.audioTracks().addTrack(AudioTrack)</code></h3>
<p>Add an existing AudioTrack to the players internal list of AudioTracks.</p>
<h3 id="-player-audiotracks-removetrack-audiotrack-"><code>player.audioTracks().removeTrack(AudioTrack)</code></h3>
<p>Remove a track from the AudioTrackList currently on the player. if no track exists this will do nothing.</p>
