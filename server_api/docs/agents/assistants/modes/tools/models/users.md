# Model: UserModels

The `UserModels` class encapsulates user-related operations, specifically user authentication actions such as login and logout. It is designed to interact with an instance of [YpAgentAssistant](../../../agentAssistant.md), which is injected via the constructor. This class serves as a foundational model for user session management, though the actual logic for login and logout is yet to be implemented.

## Properties

| Name      | Type                                   | Description                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| assistant | [YpAgentAssistant](../../../agentAssistant.md) | An instance of the agent assistant used for user-related operations. |

## Constructor

### new UserModels(assistant: YpAgentAssistant)

Creates a new instance of the `UserModels` class.

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type                                   | Description                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| assistant | [YpAgentAssistant](../../../agentAssistant.md) | The agent assistant instance to be used by the model. |

## Methods

| Name         | Parameters | Return Type | Description                                 |
|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| loginUser    | none       | Promise<void> | Initiates the user login process. (Not yet implemented) |
| logoutUser   | none       | Promise<void> | Initiates the user logout process. (Not yet implemented) |

### loginUser()

Initiates the user login process. This method is asynchronous and is intended to handle user authentication logic. Currently, the implementation is a placeholder.

#### Returns

- `Promise<void>`: Resolves when the login process is complete.

### logoutUser()

Initiates the user logout process. This method is asynchronous and is intended to handle user session termination logic. Currently, the implementation is a placeholder.

#### Returns

- `Promise<void>`: Resolves when the logout process is complete.

---

**Note:**  
The actual login and logout logic is marked as TODO and should be implemented as per the application's authentication requirements.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { YpAgentAssistant } from "../../../agentAssistant.js";
import { UserModels } from "./UserModels";

const assistant = new YpAgentAssistant(/* ...args */);
const userModel = new UserModels(assistant);

await userModel.loginUser();
await userModel.logoutUser();
```
